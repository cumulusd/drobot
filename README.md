drobot
======

This is a sample project I have been toying with off and on related to something I interacted with when I first started programming, In my high school sophomore level Computer Science class we spent the first few weeks using the Karel programming langauge. It was a very simple object oriented language with limited API that was focused on moving this robot (named Karel) around his virtual world (a 2D grid) and having him interact with walls or beepers. For whatever reason the joy I got from just moving that little robot around is something I have never forgotten.

In Objective-C objects can be messaged by dynamically creating a selector at runtime from a string. This would make it easier and more powerful to implement the Karel robot with because you could actually use the source code provided by the user to interact with the objects instead of tokenizing the string and matching symbols. There are definietly security concerns and other issues to be aware of, but when I did this small little sample I just wanted to show it could be done.
